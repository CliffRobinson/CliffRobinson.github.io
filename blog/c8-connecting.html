            <p>
                When I did the loving kindness exercise, I thought of a friend of mine, someone I'm pretty sure I've offended and is giving me the cold shoulder, but I don't know what more I can do to mend bridges with them. Reminding myself that they have reasons for feeling the way they feel, and that they're behaving this way because they believe it will preserve their own happiness makes the situation a little easier to tolerate.
