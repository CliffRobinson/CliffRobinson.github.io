            <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
        </div>
            <div class ="eight columns A">
            <p>It didn't really, because I don't really feel like I have a 'process' to prioritise. This my the first time using the skeleton framework, media queries, applying any kind of design principles, using browser icons or creating link icons, so most of the time I used was on learning those tools. It definitely felt like it took a long time to make, but that time was spent on learning tools and making mistakes rather than tinkering for tinkering's sake, which is what I think the process over product idea is supposed to discourage.  </p>

        <div class ="eight columns A">
            <p>I was already aware of a number of studies demonstrating various physical and mental health benefits. I know it is good for me, but I tend to feel like I'm doing it wrong and often treat it like a chore.</p>

        </div>
        <div class ="eight columns A">
            <p>It is really helpful to be reminded of the importance of intention - I tend to meditate because I have convinced myself it is something I am supposed to be doing, and I think that contributes to the sense of it being a chore. </p>

        <div class ="eight columns A">
            <p>The four-step model for dealing with distractions is actually a really nice response to the sense of 'doing it wrong'. I think I'll be applying this myself.  </p>
