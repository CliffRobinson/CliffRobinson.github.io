                I've had good and bad bosses. The best, bar none, was a man named John. He is a compassionate boss, but it's not immediately obvious, because one the of the things that's great about him is he doesn't care whether his employees like him (there's a difference between being compassionate and needing people to like you).

                When he wanted you to change your behaviour, he told you his expectations, in actionable and specific language, and he told you why. When you gave him bad news, he listended and considered your viewpoint and why you did what you did before responding. Even on the rare occasions it was clear that he was angry, he didn't yell or scream. He simply asked you if you had done everything your should have (again, in actionable and specific terms), and let you say yourself whether you had met the standard needed.

                Conversely, the boss I referrred to in the previous blog was not compassionate. It took me a long time to realise this, but they would often deliverately undermine my skills or personal qualities in conversation. They would ask that I change or improve on KPIs that were outside of my control (often, because those KPIs were determined directly by them). And when something went wrong, even when given clear evidence of their failings, they didn't respond or even acknowledge their problems, they just redoubled in blaming it on me.

                When I was a lawyer, I spent a lot of time thinking about waht is good and bad about working in law firms, how I would run them differently given the chance, I what kind of boss I would want to be. The shortest, best answer, is if I get to be someone's boss, I want to be a boss like John.

                I enjoyed it. The night immediately before I tried it I had an experience that embarrased and upset me. It wasn't a situation where anyone was in the wrong, but even so, it reminded me of the things that make me feel bad about myself, and I was and am worried that even though I'm doing everything I can to try and resolve it, it might still get worse. Doing the meditation helped to calm my nerves and remind me that I do have good characteristic as well. Reminding myself that everyone else is a good person is probably a good thing too, although I was aware of that consciously already.

                In a related topic, I find the instructions quite hard to follow - you need to rest your mind and focus on the breath, but also keep track of timings (do this for two minutes, then do that for two minutes) and keep track of instructions that you haven't necessarily memorized and need to refer back to the book to do, breaking your focus. I ended up finding a youtube video of the multuiplying goodness meditation (<a href="https://youtu.be/e2cLJx5Nmag">this one</a>, which is apparently the only guided meditation of this type on the internet(!?)). Looks as though some (but not all) of the suggested meditations have guided versions at <a href="https://siyli.org/resources/category/guided-meditation">this page</a>, which may be of help to others.

                It was a little difficult - I found it harder to focus on the my own and others' suffering than my something neutral like my breathing. But it was good. Part of the reason it was hard is because with the people I was thinking of, I think their suffering is largely caused by attitudes they are grasping on to, rather than anything external, which makes it easy to admonish them in your mind for 'thinking wrong', onstead of extending compassion to them.

                The way I found around this was to think about they feelings they were experiencing - discomfort, aversion, etc, breathe those in, and breathe out the opposite - confidence, sense of safety, comfort, etc. I guess that was the point to begin with, but I needed to use my unfeeling robot brain to figure out that my unfeeling robot brain wasn't the right tool for this meditation :-P.
