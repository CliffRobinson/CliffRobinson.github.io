                I've had good and bad bosses. The best, bar none, was a man named John. He is a compassionate boss, but it's not immediately obvious, because one the of the things that's great about him is he doesn't care whether his employees like him (there's a difference between being compassionate and needing people to like you).
            </p>

            <p>
                When he wanted you to change your behaviour, he told you his expectations, in actionable and specific language, and he told you why. When you gave him bad news, he listended and considered your viewpoint and why you did what you did before responding. Even on the rare occasions it was clear that he was angry, he didn't yell or scream. He simply asked you if you had done everything your should have (again, in actionable and specific terms), and let you say yourself whether you had met the standard needed. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Conversely, the boss I referrred to in the previous blog was not compassionate. It took me a long time to realise this, but they would often deliverately undermine my skills or personal qualities in conversation. They would ask that I change or improve on KPIs that were outside of my control (often, because those KPIs were determined directly by them). And when something went wrong, even when given clear evidence of their failings, they didn't respond or even acknowledge their problems, they just redoubled in blaming it on me.

                When I was a lawyer, I spent a lot of time thinking about waht is good and bad about working in law firms, how I would run them differently given the chance, I what kind of boss I would want to be. The shortest, best answer, is if I get to be someone's boss, I want to be a boss like John.
