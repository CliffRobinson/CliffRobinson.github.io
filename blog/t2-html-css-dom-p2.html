            <p>What is grid based design?</p>
        </div>
        <div class ="A">
            <p> Everything on the internet is squares, so grid based design is using a grid 
                to determine where those squares are placed relative to each other.

                <p>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</p>
            </div>
            <div class ="A">
                <p> Responsive webpages are ones built to display properly on a variety of screen 
                    sizes, which is important because more people are accessing the web on phones and tablets,
                    which have smaller screens.

                    <p>What is semantic structure?</p>

                    <p> The materials we have studied haven't used this term, but it <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">appears</a>
                        that semantic structure refers to the use of HTML tags that describe specific elements of a website, for example &lt;header&gt; 
                        which defines the header, or &lt;em&gt;, which shows the text within is emphasized. </p>
