    <h1>Cultural Blog: Time and Habits</h1>
 
    <p>I've been meditating since 2012, and most of the time I manage to do it 5-7 days a week. It's a huge help, especially in times of great external stress. I want to do it every day, and using the headspace app seems to help. Ironically, I actually prefer other guided meditations I have used, but the simple fact that Headspace tracks your numbers and lets you know how many days you've gone in a row without stoppings adds that tiny extra incentive I need to keep doing it. </p>

    <p>The pomodoro technique and Fogg's triggering tiny habits look really interesting, and they dovetail nicely. I want to make sure I get up and move around regularly while coding, so booking in to do some situps of something every pomodoro break seems great, and toggl can give me that external reminder.</p>

    <p>I've talked about external reminders a lot in this, because I know that's what I respond to. <a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/">Gretchen Rubin</a> talks a lot about the 'Four Tendancies', a framework of how people respond to obligations, and I know I'm an Obliger - that is, I respond well to external expectations but also that I struggle to meet obligations I set for myself. The answer for people like me is external structure and accountability, and something as simple as an automated notification can be enough to prompt improved behaviour. So for me, making sure there is some structure and outward accountability is going to be key to getting through this course.</p>
